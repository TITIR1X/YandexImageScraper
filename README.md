# YandexImageScraper
The script allows you to perform a search on Yandex.com using a keyword provided by the user, and then downloads a specified number of images resulting from the search. The downloaded images are stored in an HTML file in a folder specified by the user.


**For the operation of YandexImage_image_recognition.py:**
- Please upload your personal list of URLs into the **URLS.py** file. I personally use the free imgbb.com server to generate image links, which must then be inserted into URLS.py.
