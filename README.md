## YandexBot_keyword_search.py
This tool allows you to perform a search on Yandex.com using a keyword provided by the user and then downloads a specified number of images resulting from the search. The downloaded images are stored in an HTML file in a folder specified by the user.
___________________________________________________________
## YandexBot_image_recognition.py
This tool allows searching Yandex.com using a list of images provided by the user in the URL_.py file. By default, it downloads 1400 images resulting from each search and stores them in an HTML file in a user-specified folder.
___________________________________________________________
## link_extractor.py
This code allows you to extract image links from HTML files and save them to a text file. First, it goes through a user-specified folder and identifies all HTML files in it. Then, it extracts the image links from each HTML file and saves them to an individual text file with the same name as the original HTML file, but with a ".txt" file extension instead of ".html".
___________________________________________________________
## file_organizer.py
This code is used to group by 50 files from the "YandexBot_image_recognition" or "YandexBot_keyword_search" folder generated by YandexBot into files named "./1/50_src_files.html", "./2/50_src_files.html", "./3/50_src_files.html", and so on. Once the files are created, you can open them one by one and save the page to download the images to your local disk.

**file_organizer.py** can be configured to group 100 files or more (in the variable 'LIMIT=50'), by default it is set to 50.
___________________________________________________________
### To download the images, follow these steps:

1- Open the .html file

2- Right click on the file

3- Select "save page".

4- This will start the automatic download of the page and the images contained in it.

This program was created for a project called PsicoRecogn. The purpose of this project is to capture and analyze the morphopsychology of any user in order to create a detailed profile of their characteristics and provide ultra-personalization in the readings that the user makes. The project will be released gradually and the first mission is to obtain enough data to validate the usefulness of morphopsychology, as there is currently not enough data to prove it.

The programs I created for the project were designed to analyze on a massive scale.
